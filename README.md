# A Newton-Based Approach to Exclusive Lasso

Welcome to the repository for the paper titled **"A Newton-Based Approach to Exclusive Lasso for Improved Sparse Solutions"**. This repository contains Python code for reproducing the results presented in the paper.

## Overview

This repository includes implementations of the algorithms discussed in the paper:

- **Algorithm1.py**: Contains the quadratic approximation method used in the paper.
- **Algorithm3.py**: Implements the sigmoid function approximation method.

These codes are designed to help reproduce the results and validate the findings presented in the paper.

## Repository Structure

- `Algorithm1.py`: Python script for quadratic approximation.
- `Algorithm3.py`: Python script for sigmoid function approximation.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need Python along with the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:
